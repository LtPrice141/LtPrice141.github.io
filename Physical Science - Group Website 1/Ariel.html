        <p><strong> How To Use: </strong> <br> <strong>1.</strong> Use the recommended amount of Ariel detergent powder based on the load size and soil level. Generally, for a regular load, 1-2 scoops should suffice. Refer to the packaging for specific measurements.
                   <br> <strong>2. Add to the Washing Machine </strong> <br> <strong>Top-Loading Machine: </strong> Pour the detergent directly into the drum before adding clothes. If your machine has a detergent compartment, add the powder there instead. 
                   <br> <br> <strong>Front-Loading Machine:</strong>  Place the detergent in the designated compartment for powder. <br> <br> <strong>3.</strong>  Add your laundry to the washing machine, ensuring not to overload it for optimal cleaning.
                    <br> <strong>5.</strong> Choose the appropriate wash cycle and temperature based on the fabric care labels of your clothes. <br> <strong>6.</strong> Begin the wash cycle. <br> <strong>7.</strong>Once the cycle is complete, remove your laundry and dry in the sun.</p>
